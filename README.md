# Spotted on Spotify
#### Command Line Application
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/futurice/secret.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/futurice/secret)

Have you ever gone back and forth between YouTube/SoundCloud trying to add songs to your Spotify playlist, only to waste time and find that the song is not available on Spotify? Look no further!

## Requirements

From the [AcoustID](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint) documentation:
> The [Chromaprint](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint) fingerprinting library makes use of the `fpcalc` command-line tool. The static binaries for the `fpcalc` tool can be found [here](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint). 

Set the `FPCALC` environment variable to the location of the operating system appropriate version of the downloaded executable. 

## Setup

* `pip install spotted-on-spotify`
* Run `spotted-on-spotify` once to prompt the user authentication which will take you [here](https://github.com/anthonymirand/SpottedOnSpotify-cmdline).
* Paste the link into the command line.

That's it! _You're authenticated and ready to go!_

## Usage

```
$ spotted-on-spotify [ URL ]
```

When you have a specific YouTube or SoundCloud URL that you would like to search on Spotify, run the script with the URL (or wait to enter the URL while in the application), and let the _magic_ happen!

Running the script allows the creation and modification of a public Spotify playlist appropriately named "Spotted on Spotify" where successful searches will be saved.

## TODO

* Catch invalid URL error from [youtube_dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)
* Use/create a more efficient search/mapping from MusicBrainz to Spotify:
    * [MBSpotify](https://github.com/metabrainz/mbspotify) for direct matching between MusicBrainz Identifiers and Spotify URIs
* Include `fpcalc` with package
